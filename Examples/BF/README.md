# BF Examples

This folder contains multiple `boros` implementations of Brainfuck interpreters.

[`BF-Simple.brs`](BF-Simple.brs) is the simple interpreter.
[`BF.brs`](BF.brs) uses the *first-class comments* mechanism.

There's also 2 BF programs for testing: [`Hello World`](HelloWorld.bf) and [`Sierpinski Triangle`](Triangle.bf).
